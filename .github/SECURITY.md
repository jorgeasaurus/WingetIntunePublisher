# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in WingetIntunePublisher, please follow the process:

1. Go to the **Security** tab in the GitHub repository and click **"Report a vulnerability"** to create a private security advisory.
   - This ensures all communication remains private from the start.
2. A repo owner will be notified and can discuss the vulnerability privately with you.
3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for
whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
